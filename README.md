# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis – SQL & Excel Dashboard Project

**End-to-end sales performance analysis of a pizza business using SQL and Excel to uncover revenue drivers, demand patterns, and actionable business insights.**

---

## 📖 Overview

This project analyzes pizza sales data to evaluate overall business performance, identify top and underperforming products, understand customer demand trends, and support data-driven pricing, operations, and marketing decisions.  
SQL is used for data exploration and analysis, while Excel Power Pivot is used for data modeling and dashboarding.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The business lacks a consolidated view of sales performance across products, sizes, and time periods.  
This analysis aims to answer:

- Which pizzas and sizes drive the most revenue?
- When do customers place the most orders?
- Which products and sizes underperform?
- How can pricing, staffing, and promotions be optimized?

---

## 📊 Dataset

The analysis is based on four CSV files:

- **orders** – order dates and times  
- **order_details** – pizza-level order quantities  
- **pizzas** – pizza size and pricing  
- **pizza_types** – pizza names, categories, and ingredients  

These datasets were imported into MySQL and Excel for analysis and modeling.

- Friday is the **highest revenue day**, Sunday the lowest  
- **12–1 PM** is the peak revenue hour

## 📈 Dashboard / Model / Output

An interactive **Excel dashboard** built using Power Pivot includes:

- KPI summary (Revenue, Orders, AOV)  
- Daily and hourly sales trends  
- Top and bottom pizzas by revenue  
- Revenue contribution by size and category

## ✅ Results & Conclusion
